This is a Python Script that scrapes quotes from [BrainyQuotes](https://www.brainyquote.com/) for a particular Topic.

# Usage:
You need to install some python modules first.
You can install them via pip.

After you have installed pip use the following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then run:
```
python quotes-scrapper.py
```
A .txt file of the name same as topic is created within the directory from which the script was executed
